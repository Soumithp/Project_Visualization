        <p> A map was created and labeled using the data points and geographic coordinates as input. Once we choose the category, the map may be seen by location, gender, and age, which will also display the labeling and age grouping. The locations of the fatalities on the plotted map will be shown on the radial chart of age grouping and gender that was built and connected to it.To zoom into the map, there was a zoom in/out option, and the map's streets were labeled.</p>

        <p>Ages, genders, and the number of fatalities are displayed in three data fields using a radial stacked bar chart. Death rates are represented on the X axis, age ranges are represented on the Y axis, and genders are represented in groups with color-coded differences. Additionally, I produced interaction between the bar plot and map based on the hovering bar data and showed the tooltip when the mouse was over the listener. For instance, if a user hovered over a bar with the age range 0 to 10 and the gender male, spots on the map with the same information would be highlighted.</p>
        <p> Below the radial chart, a plot was created between body counts and certain days. For simplicity and clean labeling, days are labeled with a range of one week.</p>

        <p> You may choose which factors—age, gender, and geographic location—interact with each other. During the dialogue, the age groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are stated. These age groups are clearly labeled on the map. </p>
        <p> To plot the map, create a radial chart, and create a timeline graph, the  HTML code was created using D3 tools and includes the SVG. Following the creation of the map and graphing, the colors were adjusted to be color blind friendly.</p>

        <p>1. Used pathways, text symbols, street names, pump locations, brewery locations, and workhouse locations to map fatalities in various places.</p>
        <p>2. Used pathways, text symbols, street names, pump names, brewery names, and workhouse names with various color representations to map fatalities according to gender.</p>
        <p>3. Using pathways and text symbols, as well as street names, pumps, breweries, and work houses with various color representations, mapped fatalities according to the ages labels provided in the requirement description file with regard to data values.</p>
