    <p style="background-color:tomato;">Summary of the visualization:</p>
    A map was created and labeled using the data points and geographic coordinates as input. Once we choose the category, the map may be seen by location, gender, and age, which will also display the labeling and age grouping. The locations of the fatalities on the plotted map will be shown on the radial chart of age grouping and gender that was built and connected to it.
