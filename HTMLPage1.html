    After reading the requirements for this exercise, I have summarized the requirements for my project. A map is drawn with the area (streets and pumps) including the places where people died. Timeline chart showing the number of deaths per day. Ability to move the mouse over the timeline to select dates for visualization. Details of who wrote the project, where the data came from, etc. Label the 5 main street names and the location of the brewery and workhouse. The card indicates whether each victim is male or female. Mark the age of each victim on the card. The graph shows the distribution of total deaths by sex and age. Ability to view a global graph (including gender and age) with date change. Zoom in/out and pan around the map. Stable graphics and maps. Well labelled charts and maps. Colour blind friendly. Updates quickly as users interact. The sex and age of each victim should be readily identifiable. Display data clearly. Do not confuse users.
