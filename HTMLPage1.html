    <h1 style="background-color: powderblue;">Summary of the visualization:</h1>
    <p>style="text-align: center"  A map was created and labeled using the data points and geographic coordinates as input. Once we choose the category, the map may be seen by location, gender, and age, which will also display the labeling and age grouping. The locations of the fatalities on the plotted map will be shown on the radial chart of age grouping and gender that was built and connected to it.To zoom into the map, there was a zoom in/out option, and the map's streets were labeled.</p>


    <p>style="text-align: center" Below the radial chart, a plot was created between body counts and certain days. For simplicity and clean labeling, days are labeled with a range of one week.</p>

    <p>style="text-align: center" You may choose which factors—age, gender, and geographic location—interact with each other. During the dialogue, the age groups 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are stated. These age groups are clearly labeled on the map. </p>


    <h1>style="background-color: powderblue;">Design Process</h1>
    <p>To plot the map, create a radial chart, and create a timeline graph, the  HTML code was created using D3 tools and includes the SVG. Following the creation of the map and graphing, the colors were adjusted to be color blind friendly.</p>
